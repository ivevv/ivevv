## Hello! I'm Eugenia ðŸ‘‹

As a university student at *ETU Â«LETIÂ»*, I used this hub to share my coursework with professors as well as to collaborate on group projects with fellow students.

Now I'm using it to store personal projects as I learn by myself and with the help of online courses like *Hexlet*.

In pinned, ordered from most to least recent, are the projects that I feel represent my skill set the best.

I've completed a **manual testing** course from *Yandex Practicum*, and my next learning goals are **test automation** and **Unity**.
