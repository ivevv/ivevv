## Hello! I'm Eugenia 👋

As a university student at *ETU "LETI"* I used this hub to share my coursework with professors as well to collaborate on group projects with fellow students.

Now I'm using it to store personal projects as I learn by myself and with the help of online courses.
In pinned are the projects I feel resperent my skill set the best.

I've completed a **manual testing** course from *Yandex Practicum*, and my next learning goals are **test automation** and **Unity**.
