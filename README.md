## Hello! I'm Eugenia ðŸ‘‹

As a university student at *ETU Â«LETIÂ»*, I used this hub to share my coursework with professors as well as to collaborate on group projects with fellow students.

Now I'm using it to store personal projects.

In pinned, ordered from most to least recent, are the projects that I feel represent my skill set the best.

I've completed a **manual testing** (web and mobile apps, API) course from *Yandex Practicum*. [Here](https://ivevv.youtrack.cloud/dashboard?id=207-2) is my *YouTrack* Dashboard for the final project.

My next learning goals are **test automation** (*Python*) and **Unity** (*C#*).
